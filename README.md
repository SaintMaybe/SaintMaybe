- 👋 Hi, I’m @SaintMaybe
- 👀 I’m interested in ... PERL, in regards to git, but I'm trying to learn to like Python. In general? Animal activism, martial arts, fitness, true humanitarian and freedom-oriented endeavors.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... DevOps / NetOps for Arista, Cisco, and Palo Alto. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything useful - humanitarian, scientific, recreational projects. Heck, I once wrote a PERL script to generate characters comprehensively for MSHRPG. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... probably via my gmail account: stmaybe_at_gmail_dot_com
